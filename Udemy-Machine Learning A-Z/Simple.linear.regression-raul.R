# Fitting Simple Linear Regression to the Training set

# Visualising the Training set results
# First visualize the training set points and the predicted fitted line (using training set data)
# Second using the same fitted line data linear regresson is going to make prediction for new data
# therefore we wanted to see how far is the points of the test data from the fitted line (that was made
# using the training set data)
